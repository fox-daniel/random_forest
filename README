# random_forest

random_forest is a python module for training and predicting with a random forest on data with float features and binary labels (0 or 1).

## Features

* Train a random forest
* Predict with a random forest

## Data Structure

* A random forest is a list of decision trees
* Trees are defined by lists of nodes. These are all terminal nodes. Internal nodes are not saved.
* Each node is a tuple, (path, loss, predict, num):
    * path: a list that defines the region of the node, using the data structure: 
        * [(feature_column_ind, value, orientation),...] where
            * feature_column_ind: the index of a column of the array or dataframe
            * value: the value at which the split of the region is made
            * orientation: 'upper' (>) or 'lower' (<=) 
    * loss: the value of the loss function for the region defined by the path
    * predict: the class prediction for the region defined by the path
    * num: number of training points in the node 
    

## Installation

## Usage

```
import decision_tree
import random_forest

X = numpy array of features
y = numpy array of labels (0 or 1)

forest = grow_random_forest(X, y)

X' = numpy array of features of new data
predictions = forest_predict(X')
```
